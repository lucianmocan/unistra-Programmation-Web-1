# Web Programming 1

This a web programming project made during my first year of Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Strasbourg.
I did it together with a classmate, COSMO Tanguy. It uses jQuery to interact with the DOM and JS for the logic. It's a tiles game. The objective is to have each tile at it's right spot so that the image looks as it should.

This file describes (in french) what the project should achieve :
